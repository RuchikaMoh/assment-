for TASK 1 :
i  Create an S3 bucket to store and serve static files (like HTML, CSS, and JS).

Make the bucket publicly accessible so anyone can view the content.

Enable Static Website Hosting on the S3 bucket, which allows it to serve the index.html as the homepage.



FOR TASK 2: 
Write a Terraform script to automate the setup of AWS resources (EC2 instance and S3 bucket).

Parameterize the script, so it can accept variables like instance type, key pair, and bucket name to make it reusable.

Use Terraform to create an S3 bucket for static website hosting and an EC2 instance to host the website.

Terraform will handle provisioning the resources, so you donâ€™t have to manually create them through the AWS console.
